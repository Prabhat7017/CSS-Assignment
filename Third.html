Qus. => What are the different types of CSS Selectors?

CSS selectors are patterns used to select and style HTML elements. Here are the main types of CSS selectors:

1. Universal Selector (*)
Description: Selects all elements in the document.
Example:
* {
  color: red;
}
This will apply the red color to all elements in the document.


2. Type (Element) Selector
Description: Selects all elements of a specified type (tag name).
Example:
p {
  font-size: 16px;
}
This will apply the font size to all <p> elements.


3. Class Selector (.)
Description: Selects all elements with a specific class.
Example:
.my-class {
  background-color: yellow;
}
This will apply the yellow background to all elements with the class my-class.



4. ID Selector (#)
Description: Selects the element with a specific ID. An ID should be unique within the page.
Example:
#my-id {
  color: blue;
}
This will apply the blue color to the element with the ID my-id.



5. Attribute Selector
Description: Selects elements with a specific attribute or attribute value.
Example:
input[type="text"] {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
This will apply the style to all <input> elements where the type attribute is "text".


6. Pseudo-classes (:)
Description: Selects elements in a specific state, such as when an element is hovered over, or the first child of a parent.
Examples:
:hover: When the element is hovered over.
:first-child: Selects the first child of a parent.
:nth-child(): Selects elements based on their position in a list.
a:hover {
  color: red;
}
p:first-child {
  font-size: 20px;
}
li:nth-child(odd) {
  background-color: lightgray;
}
7. Pseudo-elements (::)
Description: Used to style a specific part of an element, like the first letter or line.
Examples:
::before: Inserts content before an element.
::after: Inserts content after an element.
::first-letter: Styles the first letter of an element.

p::before {
  content: "Note: ";
  font-weight: bold;
}
p::first-letter {
  font-size: 2em;
}
8. Group Selector (,)
Description: Selects multiple elements and applies the same style to all of them.
Example:
h1, h2, h3 {
  color: purple;
}
This will apply the purple color to all <h1>, <h2>, and <h3> elements.
9. Combinator Selectors
These selectors define relationships between two elements:
Descendant ( ): Selects elements that are descendants of another element.
Child (>): Selects direct children of an element.
Adjacent Sibling (+): Selects an element that is immediately next to a specified element.
General Sibling (~): Selects all elements that are siblings of a specified element.
