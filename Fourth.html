Qus.4 -> How are inline and block elements different from each other?
Sol -> 

1. Block Elements
Definition: Block elements are those that take up the entire width available to them and always begin on a new line. They extend to the full width of their parent container (unless a specific width is set).
Behavior: Block elements create a "block" or a section in the document flow. This means that other elements will appear below them, and no other elements can sit on the same line.
Examples: <div>, <p>, <h1>, <section>, <article>, <header>, <footer>
Characteristics:
Starts on a new line.
Takes up the full width available (100% width of its container).
Can have width, height, margin, and padding properties applied.


2. Inline Elements
Definition: Inline elements only take up as much width as necessary to display their content. They do not start on a new line, meaning they will appear side by side with other inline elements, if there is enough space.
Behavior: Inline elements do not affect the flow of the page like block elements do. They only occupy the space needed for their content and do not create a "block" in the layout.
Examples: <span>, <a>, <img>, <strong>, <em>
Characteristics:
Does not start on a new line; stays within the flow of the content.
Takes up only as much width as needed by the content.
Can have padding and margin applied horizontally (left and right) but not vertically (top and bottom).
